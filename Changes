Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-GenerateFile-FromShareDir

{{$NEXT}}
          - When building the a dist that matches the name of the dist which
            has the share dir, we look in the source of the sharedir for the
            file rather than in an installed sharedir. This fixes an issue
            where a bundle that uses this plugin cannot be built until the
            bundle is installed, but you can't install it because you can't
            build it. (Dave Rolsky, PR#2, RT#119340)
